# Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms commonly used in computer science. Each algorithm is designed to efficiently locate a specific element within a collection of data.

## Linear Search

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached. It is commonly used for small lists or unsorted data.

## Binary Search

Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently searches for a target element in a sorted list. It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target element is found or determined to be absent.

## Jump Search

Jump search is an improved version of linear search that works on sorted arrays. It jumps ahead by a fixed number of steps and then performs linear search in the remaining block. This approach reduces the number of comparisons required.

## Interpolation Search

Interpolation search is an algorithm that works on uniformly distributed sorted arrays. It uses interpolation formula to estimate the position of the target element and adjusts the search range accordingly.

## Exponential Search

Exponential search is a combination of binary search and linear search algorithms. It first finds a range where the target element may be present using exponential increments, and then performs binary search within that range.
